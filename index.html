			<h3 id="brief-intro">Brief intro</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m a tech and science enthusiast. Professionally, my activity covers system administration and DevOps. My main interests are *NIX environments, the infrastructure built around them, cloud computing and information security. I&rsquo;ve been involved in research activities within the field of quantum information, which led to achievements including <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=author:%22Mihai+Mina%22">publications</a> in international journals and conference proceedings.</p>
<h3 id="background-interests">Background, interests</h3>
<p>I wrote both my Bachelor and Master theses on quantum information science topics, initiatives in which I&rsquo;ve invested a great deal of dedication and time for several years. These have been the highlights for me as a student, personal endeavors I started and fostered alongside a few dedicated professors. I worked on the theoretical side and I implemented some results using IBM&rsquo;s quantum computing framework, Qiskit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m familiar with other major areas in physics. It&rsquo;s all out of passion and now I rarely get back to it, but I&rsquo;ll gladly have more or less formal/specific conversations on any subject. Other areas I&rsquo;ve explored in more detail are philosophy of mind and history of the twentieth century.</p>
<h3 id="slightly-more-detailed-intro">Slightly more detailed intro</h3>
<p>I consider perseverance and wisdom to be among the highest values one should strive to embrace. I lead and advocate for a life free of useless distractions, guided by rational and moral principles and a sense of individual independence. The comfort zone is certainly appealing most of the times, but fulfillment lies in delayed gratification. I&rsquo;m confident going that extra mile eventually pays off.</p>
<h3 id="leisure">Leisure</h3>
<p>Watching movies and TV shows is a pleasant and common way to relax. I rarely play video-games, though I sometimes check out walkthroughs of them. Outdoors, I enjoy cycling and just taking a relaxing walk in parks. The finest pieces of entertainment are those which are well worth the wait. The UEFA Euro and FIFA World Cup tournaments are such amazing events with emotional, tense and jaw-dropping moments.</p>
